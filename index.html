            <p>1st paragraph containing a sub-title for the Technicalities section.</p>
            <p>2nd paragraph giving a whole lot of technical information about the topic in this section.</p>

            <p>3rd  paragraph containing a sub-title for the Read again section.</p>
            <p>4th  paragraph with really interesting technical information that readers come back to, for reference purposes, again and again.</p>
            <p class="coded">Coding:</p>

            <p>5th  paragraph containing a sub-title for the Examples section.</p>
            <p>6th  paragraph giving practical examples where people have used the features already explained, so that the reader can relate to the theoretical models given.</p>
            <p class="coded">Coding:</p>
            <code>let i = 0;</code>

            </header>
            <p>7th  paragraph containing a sub-title for the Details section.</p>
            <p>8th  paragraph explaining technical details of this section.  <br/>  This would be a fairly long section, as it is full of useful details, explaining the concepts already given.  <br/>This could go before the <b>Examples</b> section, but to prevent the reader from getting bogged down in detailed explanations, the <b>Examples</b> section comes before the <b>Details</b> section.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Topic_5_Other_Possibilities_to_Consider">
            <header class="nav-hdr">Topic 5 Other Possibilities to Consider
            </header>
            <p>9th  paragraph containing a sub-title for the Other Possibilities section.</p>
            <p>10th  paragraph proposing alternative technical possibilities in order to give the reader a wider range of possibilities to explore.  Apart from <b>language syntax</b>, which is clearly defined and must be followed to the letter, all information is given on a &nbsp;<em>take it or leave it</em>&nbsp; basis.  <br/>This page is full of information, after all, and while suggestions of <b>best practice</b> can be offered, it should not be prescriptive in any way.</p>
            <p class="coded">Coding:</p>
            <code>total += newValue</code>
        </section>
        <p>Another (final) paragraph might contain thanks to contributors and references to research material.  This, and other information, such as Copyright and Address, might also be displayed in a footer section, which is not included in this project.</p>
        <div class="noteline">Note:</div>
        <p>
            This project is meant to emulate a Technical Information Page, as per the Javascript example given in the definition of this project.  <br/>
            However, out of the programming languages that I have played around with so far, I could not make a choice as to which one I should use for my example of a Technical Information Page.  <br/></p>
        <p>
            Add to that my intention to create my test projects from memory, as far as possible, I did not even check the correct Latin filler words in the paragraph below.  With minimal use of looking up &nbsp;<em>how to</em>&nbsp; get some effect in CSS, for example, I did add comments to show those little things that had momentarily slipped my mind.</p>
        <p>
            Therefore, I used semi-meanigful miscellaneous words, other than the usual Latin, like &nbsp;<em>'Lorem ipsom (or was it Lorem ipsem)'</em>, to fulfill the required user stories in the project definition.  Or perhaps this is just my personal style.  After all, just about every programming language already has a technical page of its own.  It is  not my intentioin to &nbsp;<em>redesign the wheel</em>&nbsp; in this project.</p>
        <p>
            The absense of a glaring white background is easier on the eyes.  <br/>And the mellow &nbsp;<em>pink and grey</em>&nbsp; color scheme is meant to help the reader to relax, so they can stress a little less and absorb more of the rather interesting technical information on display.</p>
